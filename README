This is a very simple (for now) plugin for VIm to help develop with Drupal.

It will probably include more features in the future but is not supposed to become a huge plugin:
One of the reasons I like VI is its lightness, so... This + Drush + the rest of my VIm config is enough for my usages.

For now, it only bring one command: "Hook {name}" which put under the cursor an empty implementation of the named hook.
The signature is added and the module name is guessed.

If you use this plugin, be sure to check my github repository, in case of I forget to update here:
https://github.com/webastien/vim/blob/master/vim/plugin/drupal.vim

On github, you will always find the last version and my VIm configuration (I will try to maintain this page too).
Feel free to extract parts of code you need from my sources, this could be better but I use those for my daily works without problems.
When I will have time... I will refactor and make the code cleaner. If you have suggestions, do not hesitate to propose.
